## Projects
### Used Car Analysis and Price Prediction (In Progress)
[Link](https://cars-analysis.streamlit.app/)

Data used is **scraped** from used car portals in Ghana, which is stored in **MongoDB Cloud**. The data is then explored and analyzed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. A dashboard is built and deployed using **Streamlit**. The key objective here is double-sided. First, persons who are looking to purchase used cars have this platform to explore features of a used car and how it affects it price. Secondly, used car dealers can use this platform as a guide to inform pricing, etc.
Price prediction feature ongoing*
